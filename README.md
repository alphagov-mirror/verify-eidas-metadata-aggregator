# Verify eIDAS metadata aggregator
This repository is designed to support a service that can be activated to 
refresh the eIDAS country metadata that is needed for the proxy node of each participating 
country to interact with Verify.

This used to contain code to aggregate metadata, but that code now lives in the concourse pipeline.  The only thing remaining is the JSON files in src/main/resources.
